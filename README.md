##  Application Purpose

This web application transforms a standard 404 error page into an entertaining and memorable experience. Instead of frustrating users with a dull “Page Not Found” message, it offers playful mini-games, quirky animations, and interactive jokes that engage and amuse visitors. The project highlights creativity and user experience thinking, making it perfect for portfolios and creative websites.

### Examples include:

- A pixel-art maze where users must “escape” to find the homepage.
- A button that runs away when hovered over, displaying humorous excuses like “Nope, not today!”.
- A fake “never-ending redirect loop” animation that teases users with “Redirecting… just kidding!”.
- A “404 Confessional” where users can type funny reasons why the page is missing, generating humorous AI-based responses.

# 📄 404 Page Not Found… But Fun!

## 🎯 Concept

Traditional 404 error pages frustrate users by abruptly halting their journey.  
This project reimagines the 404 experience by transforming it into an engaging, playful, and memorable interaction.  

Instead of delivering a dull "Page Not Found" message, the page offers:
- Mini-games 🎮
- Quirky animations 💫
- Interactive jokes 😂

to amuse and retain users, keeping them connected with the brand or site.

## 💡 Key Features

### 🕹️ Pixel-Art Maze Game
A retro-style maze built with the HTML Canvas API where users must **"escape"** back to the homepage.  
This adds an engaging and delightful challenge!

---

### 🐭 Runaway Button
A button that humorously dodges the cursor when hovered over, with silly messages like:
- “Not today!”
- “Catch me if you can!”
- “Maybe next time…”

A fun, unexpected interaction that adds personality and charm.

### 🔄 Fake Redirect Loop
An animated loop mimics a redirect process with playful texts:
> “Redirecting… just kidding!”

Surprises users and perfectly highlights the playful tone of the site.

---

### 💬 404 Confessional
An interactive text box invites users to type **why they think the page is missing**.  
Humorous replies (random or AI-generated) appear:
- “Gremlins ate the page.”
- “You clicked the forbidden donut link.”

Optionally backed by **Firebase** to save and display the funniest responses globally in a leaderboard style.
